# AI-Powered Product Research Assistant

This application uses AI agents to research and generate comprehensive product reviews. It employs a team of AI agents (a researcher and a writer) managed by a project manager to gather information about products, analyze them, and create detailed review articles.

## Features

- Web-based product research using DuckDuckGo or SerperDev
- Website scraping for detailed product information
- AI-powered analysis and review generation
- Support for local LLM (Ollama) or OpenAI integration
- Customizable search by product type and location (zipcode)

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Ollama (for local LLM) or OpenAI API key
- Optional: SerperDev API key for enhanced search capabilities

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:rchow93/prodsearch.git
cd prodsearch
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables in a `.env` file:
```env
# Required if using OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# Optional - for enhanced search capabilities
SERPERDEV_API_KEY=your-serperdev-api-key
```

## Configuration

The application can be configured to use either:
- Local LLM via Ollama (default configuration)
- OpenAI's GPT models (requires API key)

To use Ollama (local LLM):
- Ensure Ollama is installed and running
- update the mode as needed
- update the temperature as needed
- update the num_ctx as needed (tokens)
- Update the base_url in prodreview.py if needed:
```python
llm = ChatOllama(
    base_url="http://your-ollama-server:11434",
    model="ollama run deepseek-r1:32b",
    temperature=0,
    num_ctx=16096,
)
```

To use OpenAI:
- Uncomment the OpenAI configuration section in prodreview.py
- Ensure your API key is set in the .env file

## Usage

1. Run the script with your desired product search:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    subject = "Your Product Category"  # e.g., "Top Loading Washers that are exactly 4.3 cubic feet capacity"
    zipcode = "Your Zipcode"  # e.g., "94121"
    crew = create_crew(subject, zipcode)
    result = crew.kickoff()
```

2. Execute the script:
```bash
python prodreview.py
```
